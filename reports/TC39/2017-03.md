# TC39 Meeting January 2017

Hi everyone, it's Maggie again! I made it back to TC39 this March. Big thanks to my friends at the JS Foundation for allowing me to continue to attend TC39 meetings as their representative. This is a duty that I will share with existing rep Leo Balter of QUnint for the forseeable future.

The JS Foundation believes passionately in the power of the open source community. As such, my goal as a representative extends beyond my personal interests. I have begun championing a proposal that completely reworks the `DateTime` handling in ECMAScript, not only because I have a personal interest in this space, but also because I believe strongly that it is in the best interest of the community to fix this gaping hole in this language.

Beyond this proposal, I look to you, reader, for direction. Where do we need to take the language? What is your vision for it? What is it missing, and what needs to be fixed? Get in contact via the [JS Foundation Standards Repository](https://github.com/jsfoundation/standards) and let us know.

# Progress on Code of Conduct

Code of Conduct remained a major topic of discussion at TC39 for this meeting. The committee agreed to advanced the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/tc39/code-of-conduct-proposal) proposal to the ECMA Secratariat to review whether it is compliant with existing ECMA policy. This is a topic that reveals the large range of age and experience of TC39 delegates. There is concern among committee members about exactly what sorts of behavior constitute a code of conduct violation. In particular, members wish to have a clear definition of where the line is between expressing legitimate but strong opinions or political views and harassment. This will be an ongoing discussion for TC39, but I have so far been very appreciative of the willingness of all parties to come together and try to reach understanding. Several members of the baby boomer generation have come to me with earnest, respectful, and intelligent questions about how Millenial women view free speech, feminism, intersectionality and safe spaces. I have in turn come to understand how the impact that events outside of my experience, like McCarthyism, have influenced the boomer generation's strong desire to protect free speech.

It is amazing to see powerful work like this happen in a place where we just make a programming language. A big thanks to Leo Balter for championing this proposal with enthusiasm. We move forward together!

# Release!

The committee voted to advance the drafts of the ECMA262 and ECMA402 2017 standards to the ECMA Secretariat. This means that ECMAScript 2017 is in the books.

# Proposals

I'm not going to cover every proposal that was touched upon at the meeting, but there are a few of interest that I want to point out:
- Simd.js
- Arbitrary Precision Integers
- Realms
- Date Style / Time Style
- Date replacement

## Simd.js

SIMD, or Single Instruction, Multiple Data is a method for allowing the same instruction to be performed on multiple data sets by a single process. It has many applications in multimedia, and SIMD instructions are supported by most modern CPUs. In 2015, a proposal was introduced for Simd.js, an implementation of SIMD in the ECMAScript language. [This proposal](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_simd/) reached stage three, but was not finalized due to concerns from browser implementors. During this meeting, implementors re-iterated their belief that Web Assembly (WASM) provides a better path forward for exposing SIMD in the browser than any JS implementation would. Because there is still a need for something SIMD-like in the browser the committee will not be withdrawing the proposal. Instead, it will be regrouping at the next meeting to see if stage 1 is an appropriate place for the proposal.

## Arbitrary Precision Integers

The January meeting saw a long discussion of how to incorporate 64 bit integers into the language for purposes of OS interoperability, and for integer mathematical operations. There was extensive discussion as to whether this should be implemented as 64 bit integers or arbitrary precision integers. There was general consensus that arbitrary precision integers would have broader uses and were somewhat more future-proof. At the March meeting, the [arbitrary precision integer proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-integer) was introduced and reached stage 2 with initial spec text. This spec proposes the letter `n` as an explicit cast to integer:

```js
// Takes an Integer as an argument and returns an Integer
function nthPrime(nth) {
  function isPrime(p) {
    for (let i = 2n; i < p; i++) {
      if (p % i === 0n) return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
  for (let i = 2n; ; i++) {
    if (isPrime(i)) {
      if (--nth === 0n) return i;
    }
  }
}
```

## Realms
I saw someone on twitter requesting something like Node's VM feature be built into the browser. There is an active proposal for [Realms](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms/) that does just that. Realms create a sandbox in which arbitrary ECMAScript can be run without fear of polluting the environment. Consider the following:

```js
class FakeWindow extends Realm {
  init() {
    super.init(); // install the standard primordials
    let global = this.global;

    global.document = new FakeDocument(...);
    global.alert = new Proxy(fakeAlert, { ... });
    ...
  }
}
```
This uses the Realm proposal to make a fake browser window with a self-contained global object. This is quite useful for testing purposes, or for any situation where a user would need to execute arbitrary scripts without security fears.
