The Foundation invests significant resources in its efforts to drive Web standards on behalf of developers. The Standards Representatives coordinates those efforts, communicating on a regular basis with both the community and the projects hosted within the JS Foundation.

The Standards Representatives will:

- Know what Foundation projects are doing related to standards, and what departments or projects are involved to properly disseminate information and solicit feedback.
- Act as ambassadors to the wider web development community, and provide feedback to the Foundation regarding its impact in that community.
- State their affiliation with the JS Foundation, particularly in conferences or meetings where their attendance is a result of affiliation with, or funded by, the Foundation.
- Provide a high-level summary of the meetings they attend, and distribute those reports as widely as possible. If there is no confidential information, public distribution is preferred.
- Distribute information about upcoming standards meetings within the JS Foundation to ensure that they are attended by the appropriate representatives.
- Inform the JS Foundation and interested projects of upcoming votes in the standards bodies, and take feedback on the appropriate way to vote on the matter.
- Regularly provide reasonable data for expenses reimbursement regarding any available budget to attend meetings or events associated to their respective representation work.
