# jQuery Standards Group

The jQuery Standards Group exists to give web developers a voice in the
standards process.

It has three primary goals:

* Represent the web developer community, including people involved with any
  project at the jQuery Foundation, to any web standards body and working group
  (W3C, ECMA/TC39, WHATWG, Khronos, etc) with the intention of developing and
  improving existing standards to better meet the needs of web developers.
* Represent the web developer community, including people involved
  with any project at the jQuery Foundation, to browser vendors with the intent
  of helping them identify standards that they should prioritize for
  implementing, and proofs of concept that they can build.
* Help the jQuery Foundation projects adopt new standards and browser features
  as appropriate.

# Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct](https://jquery.org/conduct/)
and the same is expected for those who want to participate, applied equally to
founders, mentors, members and those seeking help and guidance.

# Helping

The easiest way to help is to report (or comment on) issues to the
issue tracker in this repository.

Issues should:

* Identify problems with existing specs or specs in progress
* Identify problems with existing implementations of standards

Feel free to comment on existing issues rather than opening a totally
new one. We will roll up important comments into the body of the issue
periodically to ensure that the issues are as clear as possible.

Our goal is to collect well-specified and articulate issues with the web
ecosystem as it exists today and advocate for improvements with the
standards bodies or vendors.

In general, the purpose of this project is to help shed light on what
the web community can collectively do to make the web a better place
more rapidly.

# Triage Process

If a new issue reflects the same concern as an existing issue, we will
incorporate any new information into the existing issue and close it as
a duplicate.

If it is a genuinely new issue, we might format and edit it for style
consistency, in order to help the comprehension for any other contributor.

If applicable, we will also file tickets with the appropriate standards
group, work group, or browser vendor and link the issue to the remote ticket.

# Why does the web developer community need a forum like this?

The purpose of the jQuery Standards Group is to create a forum where the
web developer community can come together to discuss shared concerns and
values.

Browser implementors, as part of their job, communicate with each other
directly about potential new standards and features. This makes their
discussion on the mailing lists and throughout the process more coherent
and reflective of their shared values.

Like implementors, this doesn't mean that we'll always agree on the
obvious best course of action, but it does mean that we'll have a place
to find areas of consensus and discuss how we would like to see the
process move forward.

By creating this forum, we hope that we give voice to the millions of
web developers deeply invested in the process but without a natural way
to aggregate their concerns.
